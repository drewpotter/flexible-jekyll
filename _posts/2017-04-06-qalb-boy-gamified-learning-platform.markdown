When I was studying Physics at University of London Royal Holloway, I had an idea. What if there was a way to help teach poor kids through an app.

## QALB-Boy app
The result of this thought process is now an app that is nearing completion for testing.

QALB-Boy is an educational art-game-storytelling platform. Written in React, Rust, Ruby-on-Rails, C++, Qml.

* React for the UI
* Rust for many of the video games
* Ruby-on-Rails for the core backend and P2P
* C++ for the Qt app
* Qml for everything you see in the Qt app

Machine learning is planned as a feature, so Python will be added to this list.

### Community collaboration

At some point it will be vital to form a community around this app if it is going to succeed.
